** Why This Guide Exists

This guide has one simple goal: to guide a complete adult beginner through the
basics of Go as quickly as possible. I hope it gives them just enough to enjoy
the game and appreciate its profound depth and beauty.

I originally wrote this to help new members of a local Go club. They all
learned way faster than any intro book seemed to expect. I wanted a quick,
handy guide to show examples during club meetings, and something they could
take home for easy review. Thus this guide.

We prioritize speed over depth here. If you notice any words or figures that
don't add value, let me know, and I'll remove them to keep the content
concise.

** Fast Way to Kick Start

The fastest way to kick start: Community, Play, and Practice!

Gather some friends or join a community to play and discuss! This is the
quickest way to kick start in any field. For online platforms, we currently
best recommend [[https://online-go.com/][OGS]].

When practicing solo, work through Go problems and exercises - there are tons
available. On mobile phones, we currently best recommend the free app BadukPop
Go ([[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.coreplane.badukpop.prod&hl=en_CA][Android]] and [[https://apps.apple.com/us/app/badukpop-go/id1472684271][iOS]]).
