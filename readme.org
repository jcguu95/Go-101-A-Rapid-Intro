** Preface
*** Why This Guide Exists

This guide has one simple goal: to guide a complete adult beginner through the
basics of Go as quickly as possible. I hope it gives them just enough to enjoy
the game and appreciate its profound depth and beauty.

I originally wrote this to help new members of a local Go club. They all
learned way faster than any intro book seemed to expect. I wanted a quick,
handy guide to show examples during club meetings, and something they could
take home for easy review. Thus this guide.

We prioritize speed over depth here. If you notice any words or figures that
don't add value, let me know, and I'll remove them to keep the content
concise.

*** Fast Way to Kick Start

The fastest way to kick start: Community, Play, and Practice!

Gather some friends or join a community to play and discuss! This is the
quickest way to kick start in any field, and Go is no different. Currently,
the online platform [[https://online-go.com/][OGS]] is great.

To improve quickly as a beginner, play handicap games with stronger players.
While diving into big fights can be fun, if fast progress is your goal, focus
first on defensive play and gradually work on efficiency. Healthy Mindset Tip:
Don't be shy about handicap games! Go skill, like muscle strength, takes time
to build. Winning against someone 4-5 ranks higher is extremely unlikely, so
focus on growth over wins.

When practicing solo, work through Go problems and exercises - there are tons
available. For mobile practice, we currently recommend BadukPop Go (a free app
for Android and iOS).

** Foundations
*** The Rules of Go

1. Stone Placement

   Go is a two-player game. One player takes Black, and the other takes White,
   with Black going first. Players alternately place stones on intersections
   of the board.

2. Groups and Liberties

   Stones of the same color connected through lines form a group. The group's
   liberty is the number of adjacent empty intersections. A group with zero
   liberties is "dead" or "captured" and is removed from the board, with the
   captured stones.

3. No-Suicide

   A move cannot leave one's own stones without liberties, unless it
   simultaneously captures an opponent's group. In this case, the opponent's
   group is captured and removed, while one's own group remains on the board.

4. No-Repetition (Ko)

   A move cannot recreate a previous board position, a rule known as ko. For
   example, starting from Figure 1 with Black's turn, if Black captures a
   stone as shown, White cannot immediately recapture in the same position
   (Figure 2). White must play elsewhere first, hoping Black responds,
   allowing White to retake later (Figure 3).

5. Territory Counting

   - End-of-game example on a 7x7 board

     Figure 5 shows a completed game where additional moves would not affect
     the score. Black has one large territory totaling 27 points, while White
     has two territories totaling 22 points. Typically, the player with more
     points wins; thus, Black would win here. However, due to Black's
     advantage of playing first, White is conventionally given 6.5 free points
     to start with, bringing White's score to 28.5 points. With this, White
     wins by 1.5 points.

   - End-of-game example on a 19x19 board

     Figure 6 shows a completed game on the standard 19x19 board. Although
     additional moves could seem possible, fundamental reading skills reveal
     that further play would not affect the score (explained later in this
     book). For now, take this as given. Black totals 183 points, while White
     totals 178 points. With 6.5 free points, White wins by reaching 184.5
     points

*** The Way of Survival: Two Eyes

Notice that each group must have two eyes to survive until the end of the
game. What if a group has only one eye? As shown in Figure 1, it will
eventually be captured due to the exception in the No-Suicide rule, leading to
its inevitable death.

To ensure a group's survival, it must have at least two eyes. This is because
your opponent can only place one stone per turn and must follow the no-suicide
rule, making it impossible for them to fill both eyes. Here are a few
examples. [TODO: Images]

However, focusing solely on making your group absolutely live can slow your
pace too much. For example, in the following image, after six moves, Black
creates a perfectly safe group but controls only 8 points, while White
controls about 25 points! Striking a balance between efficiency and resiliency
is key. Mastering this balance is a high-level skill, and even the best
players and computers can't achieve it perfectly.

One implication is that a group of stones can be effectively dead before it's
officially captured. In the following image, for example, although White's
group still has 10 liberties, we know it won't survive because there's no
space to create two eyes.

Consider another example: the Black stone has four liberties and appears to
have plenty space to form two eyes within the marked area. However, it's clear
that creating two eyes would require at least five additional moves, and White
can interrupt this attempt at any time. Therefore, this Black stone is
effectively dead. This raises the question: when should Black have escaped
with this stone? Was it in Figure 2, Figure 3, or Figure 4? The perfect timing
remains uncertain, as it's a computationally complex question that even
experts cannot answer with absolute certainty. Though Go is a finite game, its
behavior unfolds in ways that are effectively continuous, reaching enormous
complexity. This intricacy brings to mind Conway's Game of Life and the idea
that, like Go, our world might also be a vast, finite machine - where simple
rules give rise to complex, seemingly infinite patterns.

This introduces the concept of *health* or *thickness* in Go. A group of stones
isn't simply alive or dead; it has a health status that exists on a continuous
spectrum—something even computers can't precisely calculate. Mastery in Go
involves skillfully assessing and managing this health. What makes the game
engaging, almost “near-art,” is watching strong players overturn your
perception of a group's vitality, bringing unexpected liveliness and drama to
the board!

*** Sample Games

In this section, let's examine two sample games on a 7x7 board. The first game
is straightforward, while the second is more rugged, demonstrating the
importance of fundamentals.

In the first game, Black and White each root at the corners and establish
control along the sides. Black then moves to the center, and White begins
probing the areas where their influence meets. Both players then solidify
their boundaries. In the end, Black has [TODO] points, and White has [TODO]
points. With 6.5 free points, White reaches [TODO] points and wins.

In the second game, the openings are similar. However, White goes to far while
probing, giving Black an opportunity to bend the White stone into Black's
territory. This puts the White stone in a highly vulnerable position, and
further analysis suggests it's almost impossible to save. Such mistakes—and
subtler ones like it—are common in all games. If Black fails to recognize the
chance to punish, Black might play a defensive move instead, missing the
opportunity to gain an advantage. Conversely, if Black sees the opportunity
but misplays the punishment, they risk losing more points than necessary.

The game continues, and once again, White prioritizes speed over defense, when
a defensive move at X was needed to prevent a double pre-capture. But once
again, it's easier said than done; the balance between efficiency and
resiliency is a challenging art to master.

** Fundamentals

In the previous section, you saw some sample games. To truly enjoy Go, I
believe it's essential to avoid basic mistakes. But what qualifies as "basic"?
This guide defines it right here. If you can avoid the mistakes outlined in
this section, I guarantee your games will become more enjoyable, and you'll
start to appreciate the profound depth and beauty of Go.
