* Go 101: A Rapid Intro

[[file:./img/cover.png]]

** Preface
*** Why This Guide Exists

This guide has one simple goal: to guide a complete adult beginner through the
basics of Go as quickly as possible. I hope it gives them just enough to enjoy
the game and appreciate its profound depth and beauty.

I originally wrote this to help new members of a local Go club. They all
learned way faster than any intro book seemed to expect. I wanted a quick,
handy guide to show examples during club meetings, and something they could
take home for easy review. Thus this guide.

We prioritize speed over depth here. If you notice any words or figures that
don't add value, let me know, and I'll remove them to keep the content
concise.

*** Fast Way to Kick Start

** Foundations
*** The Rules of Go

1. Stone Placement

   Go is a two-player game. One player takes Black, and the other takes White,
   with Black going first. Players alternately place stones on intersections
   of the board.

2. Chains and Liberties

   Stones of the same color connected through lines form a chain. The chain's
   liberty is the number of adjacent empty intersections. For example, in fig.
   000, the numbers are the liberties of the chains.

   + (fig. 000) [[file:./img/000.png]]

   A chain with zero liberties is "dead" or "captured" and is removed from the
   board, with the captured stones (fig 001, 002).

   + (fig. 001) [[file:./img/001.png]]
   + (fig. 002) [[file:./img/002.png]]

3. No-Suicide

   A move cannot leave one's own stones without liberties, unless it
   simultaneously captures an opponent's chain. In this case, the opponent's
   chain is captured and removed, while one's own chain remains on the board
   (fig 003, 004).

   + (fig. 003) [[file:./img/003.png]]
   + (fig. 004) [[file:./img/004.png]]

4. No-Repetition (Ko)

   A move cannot recreate a previous board position, a rule known as ko. For
   example, starting from fig. 005 if Black has captured a stone as shown,
   White cannot immediately recapture in the same position. Instead, White
   must play elsewhere first, hoping Black responds, allowing White to retake
   later.

   + (fig. 005) [[file:./img/005.png]]

5. Territory Counting

   - End-of-game example on a 7x7 board

     Fig. 006 shows a completed game where additional moves would not affect
     the score. Black has one large group totaling 27 points, while White has
     two groups (11 points each) totaling 22 points.

     + (fig. 006) [[file:./img/006.png]]

     Typically, the player with more points wins; thus, Black would win here.
     However, due to Black's advantage of playing first, White is
     conventionally given 7.5 free points to start with, bringing White's
     score to 28.5 points. With this, White wins by 1.5 points.

*** The Way of Survival: Two Eyes

An important notion in Go is "eye". An eye is a connected empty space
surrounded by a single color. For example, in fig. 006, the only Black group
has three eyes, while each of the White groups has two eyes.

Notice that each group must have two eyes to survive until the end of the
game. What if a group has only one eye? As shown in fig. 007, the single black
group will eventually be captured due to the exception in the No-Suicide rule,
leading to its inevitable death.

+ (fig. 007) [[file:./img/007.png]]

To ensure a group's survival, it must have at least two eyes. This is because
your opponent can only place one stone per turn and must follow the no-suicide
rule, making it impossible for them to fill both eyes.

Therefore, it is crucial at critical moments to make two eyes (e.g. Black
plays at the triangles in fig. 008), or conversely to prevent your opponent
from making two eyes by "breaking eye" (e.g. White plays at the triangles in
fig. 008).

+ (fig. 008) [[file:./img/008.png]]

However, focusing solely on making your group absolutely live can slow your
pace too much. For example, in fig. 009, after six moves, Black creates a
perfectly safe group but controls only 8 points, while White controls half of
the board!

+ (fig. 009) [[file:./img/009.png]]

Striking a balance between efficiency and resiliency is key. Mastering this
balance is a high-level skill, and even the best players or the fastest
computers can't achieve it perfectly.

One implication is that a group of stones can be effectively dead before it's
officially captured. In fig. 010, for example, although White's group still
has 10 liberties, we know it won't survive because there's no space to create
two eyes.

+ (fig. 010) [[file:./img/010.png]]

Consider another example: In fig. 011, the Black stone has four liberties and
appears to have plenty space to form two eyes within the marked area. However,
it has no "time". Indeed, it is clear that creating two eyes would require at
least five additional moves (fig. 012), and White can interrupt this attempt
at any time. Therefore, this Black stone is effectively dead.

+ (fig. 011) [[file:./img/011.png]]
+ (fig. 012) [[file:./img/012.png]]

This raises the question: when should Black have escaped with this stone? Was
it fig. 013, fig. 014, or fig. 015?

+ (fig. 013) [[file:./img/013.png]]
+ (fig. 014) [[file:./img/014.png]]
+ (fig. 015) [[file:./img/015.png]]

The perfect timing remains unknown in general, as it is a computationally
complex question that even the fastest computer cannot answer with absolute
certainty. Though Go is a finite game, its behavior unfolds in ways that are
effectively infinitesimally continuous, reaching enormous complexity. (This
intricacy brings to mind Conway's Game of Life and the idea that, like Go, our
world might also be a vast, finite machine - where simple rules give rise to
complex, seemingly infinite patterns.)

This introduces the concept of *thickness* in Go. A group of stones isn't simply
alive or dead; it has a health status that exists on a continuous
spectrum—something even computers can't precisely calculate.

Mastery in Go involves skillfully assessing and managing the thickness of the
groups. What makes the game engaging, almost “near-art,” is watching strong
players overturn your perception of a group's vitality, bringing unexpected
liveliness and drama to the board!

*** Sample Games

In this section, let's examine two sample games on a 7x7 board. The first game
is straightforward, while the second is more rugged, demonstrating the
importance of fundamentals.

In the first game, Black and White each root at the corners and Black takes
the center (fig. 016). Then White begins probing the areas where they meet
(fig. 017). Both players then solidify their boundaries (fig. 018).

+ (fig. 016) [[file:./img/016.png]]
+ (fig. 017) [[file:./img/017.png]]
+ (fig. 018) [[file:./img/018.png]]

In the end, Black has 22 points, and White has 27 points. With 7.5 free
points, White reaches 34.5 points and wins.

In the second game, the openings are similar. However, White goes too far
while probing, giving Black an opportunity to bend the White stone into
Black's territory (by playing at A in fig. 019). This puts the White stone in
a highly vulnerable position, and further analysis suggests it's almost
impossible to save. Such mistakes—and subtler ones like it—are common in all
games. If Black fails to recognize the chance to punish, Black might play a
defensive move instead (e.g. B in fig. 019), missing the opportunity to gain
an advantage. Conversely, if Black sees the opportunity but misplays the
punishment, they risk losing even more points.

+ (fig. 019) [[file:./img/019.png]]

The game continues, and once again, in fig. 020, White prioritizes speed over
defense too much when a defensive move is needed to prevent a double
pre-capture at A.

+ (fig. 020) [[file:./img/020.png]]

** Fundamentals

Sooner or later, you'll start crafting strategies to set up on the board. Some
of your plans will have clever touches that's only obvious to you. And when
they unfold just as you envisioned, the satisfaction is unmatched. However, as
we saw in the previous section, a lack of basic skills can keep these plans
from succeeding. So before diving into grand, delicate, long-term strategies,
it's essential to get comfortable with the fundamentals.

*** Capture

In this section, we'll cover basic capturing techniques. On the flip side,
this also means you'll learn how to defend against those same techniques.

- Double Pre-capture

  Stones connect to form chains, and chains combine to form groups. However,
  sometimes your group’s chains may have critical weak points that can be cut.
  One of these vulnerabilities is known as a "double pre-capture." In the
  following two figures, the triangles mark these critical cutting points. If
  it’s White’s turn, White should play there to defend. If it’s Black’s turn,
  Black aims to play there to initiate a double pre-capture—meaning that on
  the next move, Black can capture at least one of White’s chains.


  + [[file:./img/double-precapture-1.png]] (double-precapture-1.png)
  + [[file:./img/double-precapture-2.png]] (double-precapture-2.png)

- Encircling Pre-capture

  Usually, a simple pre-capture isn’t very powerful, as the opponent can often
  escape by extending their chain. For example, in the figure below, if Black
  plays at B, this is a normal pre-capture, and White can simply extend the
  chain by playing at A to escape. However, if Black plays at A, White has no
  way to save that stone! This tactic is called an "encircling pre-capture."

  + [[file:./img/encircling-precapture-1.png]] (encircling-precapture-2.png)

- Ladder and Breakers

  In Go, there's a shape that requires calculating several moves ahead, yet it
  becomes surprisingly simple once you get the hang of it. This is called a
  "ladder."

  A ladder setup is shown in figure ladder-1, where Black can capture the
  marked White stone if it is Black's turn. If Black plays at C6, White can
  respond at B6 to escape, making Black's attempt unsuccessful. Instead, to
  capture White, Black should play as shown in figure ladder-2, guiding
  White's escape in a direction that benefits Black. Black can continue to
  apply pre-capturing pressure, forcing White to keep retreating, until the
  end of the board (figure ladder-4)!

  + [[file:./img/ladder-1.png]] (ladder-1.png)
  + [[file:./img/ladder-2.png]] (ladder-2.png)
  + [[file:./img/ladder-3.png]] (ladder-3.png)
  + [[file:./img/ladder-4.png]] (ladder-4.png)

  A ladder is powerful, but it must be used with caution. Looking again at
  figure ladder-4, while we see Black's success, it's a brittle one. Notice
  how many pre-capture points Black has! This means that if Black fails to
  maintain the rhythm of pre-capturing, they could quickly find themselves in
  trouble.

  This means that if White realizes they are at a disadvantage in the ladder,
  instead of trying to escape immediately, White could consider placing a
  ladder breaker along the path. For example, point B in figure
  ladder-breaker-1. If Black overlooks this ladder breaker and continues to
  pursue the ladder, White will eventually connect to it, disrupting Black's
  laddering sequence and placing Black in sudden danger due to their many
  vulnerable pre-capture points (figure ladder-breaker-2)!

  + [[file:./img/ladder-breaker-1.png]] (ladder-breaker-1.png)
  + [[file:./img/ladder-breaker-2.png]] (ladder-breaker-2.png)

  On the other hand, if Black notices a ladder breaker, they should either
  abandon the ladder plan, or place a ladder anti-breaker along the
  path—positioned somewhere before White's ladder breaker.

- Net

  Closely related to a ladder is a net, as shown in the following figures. To
  capture the marked white stone, a ladder would fail for Black due to White's
  ladder breaker. Instead, Black can play at A, slightly further from White.
  Although this move may seem less forceful, it's actually more effective!
  This kind of "flexible wins rigid" philosophy appears frequently on the
  19x19 board.

  + [[file:./img/net-1.png]]
  + [[file:./img/net-2.png]]
  + [[file:./img/net-3.png]]

  A fancier net is shown in the following figures:

  + [[file:./img/net-4.png]]
  + [[file:./img/net-5.png]]

- Snap-Back

  Sometimes, a sacrifice is essential—this perfectly describes the "snap-back"
  technique. Take a look at the following figure. To capture the marked White
  stones, Black shouldn't play at B, which would be a typical pre-capture.
  Instead, Black should place a stone at the seemingly risky point A. If White
  captures that stone by playing at B, Black can then immediately capture all
  the marked White stones in return! It's like magic!

  + [[file:./img/snapback.png]]

- Connect-yet-Die

  Connection does not always save your stones! For example, in the following
  figure, the marked White stones are dead once Black plays at A. Even though
  White tries to connect at B, upon connection A could take all stones away
  at C.

  + [[file:./img/connect-yet-die-1.png]]
  + [[file:./img/connect-yet-die-2.png]]

*** Escape / Extension

A common move to expand your group of stones is called a "general extension."
This is especially useful when your stones are in danger. For example, in the
next figure, White needs to escape immediately; otherwise, Black could play at
A to trap and pressure White.

+ [[file:./img/extension-1.png]]

There are several types of extension moves, shown in the following figures. In
order, they are: direct extension, 1-space jump, 2-space jump, knight's move,
elephant's move, and diagonal move. Each has unique characteristics, but
generally, the smaller the extension, the stronger the connection—though it
sacrifices efficiency. For instance, a direct extension provides the most
solid connection here, but it's a bit slow for this situation. A 2-space jump
allows for a seemingly faster escape from danger, but Black could easily cut
the two White stones apart. The elephant's move is also fast, yet it exposes a
weakness at point A.

For escaping danger, the 1-space jump and diagonal move are the most common
choices. They strike a good balance between resilience and efficiency in most
situations, yet there are important differences. For instance, their
directions vary. This might seem minor on a small board, but in a serious game
on a standard 19x19 board, you often need to choose your escape direction
carefully to avoid future threats. Additionally, while the 1-space jump is
slightly faster than the diagonal move, it's also inherently weaker. In very
rare cases, where Black's surrounding groups are extremely strong, Black could
still forcefully cut by playing at C4!

- [[file:./img/extension-2.png]]
- [[file:./img/extension-3.png]]
- [[file:./img/extension-4.png]]
- [[file:./img/extension-5.png]]
- [[file:./img/extension-6.png]]
- [[file:./img/extension-7.png]]

*** Connect and Cut

Look for weak connections among chains. For example, in the first figure
below, if it's White's turn, White could cut at A, forcing Black to connect at
D3. Then, White can extend to B, encircling the two marked Black stones, as
shown in the second figure.

If it's Black's turn, Black must defend this weak spot by connecting—either
with a direct connection at A or a tiger-mouth connection at B. The latter is
slightly weaker but, in certain situations, can offer better control over
nearby area.

- [[file:./img/cut-1.png]]
- [[file:./img/cut-2.png]]

So it may seems tempting to cut. But before you cut, you need to think why you
should. If a cut does no good, effectively you loose a move, which usually
means loosing ~10 points all of the sudden. For example, in the following
figure, White cutting at A has no effect at all as all Black groups around are
strong. Therefore, White should not cut.

- [[file:./img/cut-3.png]]

*** Endgame Basics

In the example below, White must connect the cutting point below; otherwise,
Black can pre-capture White's stone on the bottom line and chase it all the
way to the edge of the board.

- [[file:./img/endgame-1.png]]
- [[file:./img/endgame-2.png]]

Here's another common example. White must connect at A; otherwise, Black can
play at A to encircle White's stone at C2, leaving White with no way to save
it.

- [[file:./img/endgame-3.png]]
- [[file:./img/endgame-4.png]]

And here's a similar situation: if White plays at A, it effectively encircles
the two Black stones, capturing them.

- [[file:./img/endgame-7.png]]

Finally, we have a very common scenario. If it's Black's turn, the most
ambitious yet reasonable way to reduce White's territory is to make a large
knight's move, as shown. It is important to take some time to confirm that
this large knight move is secure and will not be cut off from Black's base.

- [[file:./img/endgame-5.png]]
- [[file:./img/endgame-6.png]]

*** Capture Race

- Counting Liberties
- Mutual Life Situations
- Eye-based Kills

Capture occurs when one group is in immediate danger. But what if two groups
of different colors, intertwined and both at risk, are in danger
simultaneously? This situation is called a capture race. It's crucial to
assess the situation carefully and decide your next move. If your current move
won't affect the capture race outcome, it may be best to use it elsewhere.
However, if this move is pivotal, it's worth considering.

The simplest capture race involves comparing liberties on each side. In the
following example, the endangered stones are marked, with White having three
liberties and Black two. If it's White's turn, they don't need to respond
directly and could play elsewhere (for example, an endgame move at the top).
The same applies to Black. However, if both intertwined groups have an equal
number of liberties, each side should prioritize this area—whoever plays there
first will win the capture race.

- [[file:./img/capture-race-1.png]]

Here's an interesting example: the two intertwined groups each lack eyes.
However, neither will be captured because whichever group attempts to kill the
other would end up being captured itself. As a result, neither side will make
a move here. This unique situation is known as a “mutual life.”

- [[file:./img/capture-race-2.png]]

The same situation occurs when both endangered groups each have only one eye.
Please confirm for yourself that the marked stones of both colors in the
following example are in this situation: neither group will make a capturing
move, and both will survive until the end of the game, even without having two
eyes.

- [[file:./img/capture-race-4.png]]

The situation changes if one group has an eye and the other has none. In the
following example, White wins the capture race (meaning all of Black's marked
stones are captured) because White has an eye. Verify this.
