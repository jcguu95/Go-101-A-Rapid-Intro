* Fundamentals

Sooner or later, you'll start crafting strategies to set up on the board. Some
of your plans will have clever touches that's only obvious to you. And when
they unfold just as you envisioned, the satisfaction is unmatched. However, as
we saw in the previous section, a lack of basic skills can keep these plans
from succeeding. So before diving into grand, delicate, long-term strategies,
it's essential to get comfortable with the fundamentals.

** Capture

In this section, we'll cover basic capturing techniques. On the flip side,
this also means you'll learn how to defend against those same techniques.

- Double Pre-capture

  Stones connect to form chains, and chains combine to form groups. However,
  sometimes your group’s chains may have critical weak points that can be cut.
  One of these vulnerabilities is known as a "double pre-capture." In the
  following two figures, the triangles mark these critical cutting points. If
  it’s White’s turn, White should play there to defend. If it’s Black’s turn,
  Black aims to play there to initiate a double pre-capture—meaning that on
  the next move, Black can capture at least one of White’s chains.

- Encircling Pre-capture

  Usually, a simple pre-capture isn’t very powerful, as the opponent can often
  escape by extending their chain. For example, in the figure below, if Black
  plays at B, this is a normal pre-capture, and White can simply extend the
  chain by playing at A to escape. However, if Black plays at A, White has no
  way to save that stone! This tactic is called an "encircling pre-capture."

- Ladder and Breakers

  In Go, there's a shape that requires calculating several moves ahead, yet it
  becomes surprisingly simple once you get the hang of it. This is called a
  "ladder."

  A ladder setup is shown in figure ladder-1, where Black can capture the
  marked White stone if it is Black's turn. If Black plays at C6, White can
  respond at B6 to escape, making Black's attempt unsuccessful. Instead, to
  capture White, Black should play as shown in figure ladder-2, guiding
  White's escape in a direction that benefits Black. Black can continue to
  apply pre-capturing pressure, forcing White to keep retreating, until the
  end of the board (figure ladder-4)!

  + [[file:./img/ladder-1.png]] (ladder-1.png)
  + [[file:./img/ladder-2.png]] (ladder-2.png)
  + [[file:./img/ladder-3.png]] (ladder-3.png)
  + [[file:./img/ladder-4.png]] (ladder-4.png)

  A ladder is powerful, but it must be used with caution. Looking again at
  figure ladder-4, while we see Black's success, it's a brittle one. Notice
  how many pre-capture points Black has! This means that if Black fails to
  maintain the rhythm of pre-capturing, they could quickly find themselves in
  trouble.

  This means that if White realizes they are at a disadvantage in the ladder,
  instead of trying to escape immediately, White could consider placing a
  ladder breaker along the path. For example, point B in figure
  ladder-breaker-1. If Black overlooks this ladder breaker and continues to
  pursue the ladder, White will eventually connect to it, disrupting Black's
  laddering sequence and placing Black in sudden danger due to their many
  vulnerable pre-capture points (figure ladder-breaker-2)!

  + [[file:./img/ladder-breaker-1.png]] (ladder-breaker-1.png)
  + [[file:./img/ladder-breaker-2.png]] (ladder-breaker-2.png)

  On the other hand, if Black notices a ladder breaker, they should either
  abandon the ladder plan, or place a ladder anti-breaker along the
  path—positioned somewhere before White's ladder breaker.

- Net

  Closely related to a ladder is a net, as shown in the following figures. To
  capture the marked white stone, a ladder would fail for Black due to White's
  ladder breaker. Instead, Black can play at A, slightly further from White.
  Although this move may seem less forceful, it's actually more effective!
  This kind of "flexible wins rigid" philosophy appears frequently on the
  19x19 board.

  + [[file:./img/net-3.png]]

  A fancier net is shown in the following figures:

- Snap-Back

  Sometimes, a sacrifice is essential—this perfectly describes the "snap-back"
  technique. Take a look at the following figure. To capture the marked White
  stones, Black shouldn't play at B, which would be a typical pre-capture.
  Instead, Black should place a stone at the seemingly risky point A. If White
  captures that stone by playing at B, Black can then immediately capture all
  the marked White stones in return! It's like magic!

  + [[file:./img/snapback.png]]

- Connect-yet-Die

  Connection does not always save your stones! For example, in the following
  figure, the marked White stones are dead once Black plays at A. Even though
  White tries to connect at B, upon connection A could take all stones away
  at C.

  + [[file:./img/connect-yet-die-1.png]]
  + [[file:./img/connect-yet-die-2.png]]

** Escape / Extension

A common move to expand your group of stones is called a "general extension."
This is especially useful when your stones are in danger. For example, in the
next figure, White needs to escape immediately; otherwise, Black could play at
A to trap and pressure White.

+ [[file:./img/extension-1.png]]

There are several types of extension moves, shown in the following figures. In
order, they are: direct extension, 1-space jump, 2-space jump, knight's move,
elephant's move, and diagonal move. Each has unique characteristics, but
generally, the smaller the extension, the stronger the connection—though it
sacrifices efficiency. For instance, a direct extension provides the most
solid connection here, but it's a bit slow for this situation. A 2-space jump
allows for a seemingly faster escape from danger, but Black could easily cut
the two White stones apart. The elephant's move is also fast, yet it exposes a
weakness at point A.

For escaping danger, the 1-space jump and diagonal move are the most common
choices. They strike a good balance between resilience and efficiency in most
situations, yet there are important differences. For instance, their
directions vary. This might seem minor on a small board, but in a serious game
on a standard 19x19 board, you often need to choose your escape direction
carefully to avoid future threats. Additionally, while the 1-space jump is
slightly faster than the diagonal move, it's also inherently weaker. In very
rare cases, where Black's surrounding groups are extremely strong, Black could
still forcefully cut by playing at C4!

- [[file:./img/extension-7.png]]

** Connect and Cut

Look for weak connections among chains. For example, in the first figure
below, if it's White's turn, White could cut at A, forcing Black to connect at
D3. Then, White can extend to B, encircling the two marked Black stones, as
shown in the second figure.

If it's Black's turn, Black must defend this weak spot by connecting—either
with a direct connection at A or a tiger-mouth connection at B. The latter is
slightly weaker but, in certain situations, can offer better control over
nearby area.

- [[file:./img/cut-1.png]]
- [[file:./img/cut-2.png]]

So it may seems tempting to cut. But before you cut, you need to think why you
should. If a cut does no good, effectively you loose a move, which usually
means loosing ~10 points all of the sudden. For example, in the following
figure, White cutting at A has no effect at all as all Black groups around are
strong. Therefore, White should not cut.

- [[file:./img/cut-3.png]]

** Endgame Basics

In the example below, White must connect the cutting point below; otherwise,
Black can pre-capture White's stone on the bottom line and chase it all the
way to the edge of the board.

- [[file:./img/endgame-1.png]]
- [[file:./img/endgame-2.png]]

Here's another common example. White must connect at A; otherwise, Black can
play at A to encircle White's stone at C2, leaving White with no way to save
it.

- [[file:./img/endgame-3.png]]
- [[file:./img/endgame-4.png]]

And here's a similar situation: if White plays at A, it effectively encircles
the two Black stones, capturing them.

- [[file:./img/endgame-7.png]]

Finally, we have a very common scenario. If it's Black's turn, the most
ambitious yet reasonable way to reduce White's territory is to make a large
knight's move, as shown. It is important to take some time to confirm that
this large knight move is secure and will not be cut off from Black's base.

** Capture Race

- Counting Liberties
- Mutual Life Situations
- Eye-based Kills

Capture occurs when one group is in immediate danger. But what if two groups
of different colors, intertwined and both at risk, are in danger
simultaneously? This situation is called a capture race. It's crucial to
assess the situation carefully and decide your next move. If your current move
won't affect the capture race outcome, it may be best to use it elsewhere.
However, if this move is pivotal, it's worth considering.

The simplest capture race involves comparing liberties on each side. In the
following example, the endangered stones are marked, with White having three
liberties and Black two. If it's White's turn, they don't need to respond
directly and could play elsewhere (for example, an endgame move at the top).
The same applies to Black. However, if both intertwined groups have an equal
number of liberties, each side should prioritize this area—whoever plays there
first will win the capture race.

- [[file:./img/capture-race-1.png]]

Here's an interesting example: the two intertwined groups each lack eyes.
However, neither will be captured because whichever group attempts to kill the
other would end up being captured itself. As a result, neither side will make
a move here. This unique situation is known as a “mutual life.”

- [[file:./img/capture-race-2.png]]

The same situation occurs when both endangered groups each have only one eye.
Please confirm for yourself that the marked stones of both colors in the
following example are in this situation: neither group will make a capturing
move, and both will survive until the end of the game, even without having two
eyes.

- [[file:./img/capture-race-4.png]]

The situation changes if one group has an eye and the other has none. In the
following example, White wins the capture race (meaning all of Black's marked
stones are captured) because White has an eye. Verify this.

- [[file:./img/capture-race-3.png]]

** Life and Death

In most cases, a group of stones needs at least two eyes to survive until the
end of the game (an exception being the aforementioned "mutual life").
However, we've also seen that rushing to make two eyes for each group can slow
you down significantly. Instead, the goal is to find the perfect timing to
create (if defending) or break (if attacking) a second eye.

If your first eye is large enough, you do not need to make a second one.
However, if it's reduced to smaller spaces like those shown in the following
examples, then creating or breaking the second eye at the marked points
becomes essential. It's very important to verify these situations on your own
a few times.

- [[file:./img/life-and-death-1.png]]
- [[file:./img/life-and-death-2.png]]
- [[file:./img/life-and-death-3.png]]
- [[file:./img/life-and-death-4.png]]
- [[file:./img/life-and-death-5.png]]
- [[file:./img/life-and-death-6.png]]

The following case, though Black has 4 points in its eye, it is effectively
dead, because it takes two moves to make an eye. Upon attempt, White could
interrupt it. Therefore, both sides need not play here anymore.

- [[file:./img/life-and-death-7.png]]

In the followings though, Black has lived, as White needs two moves to break
the second eye. Upon attempt, Black could interrupt it. Therefore, both sides
need not play here anymore.
